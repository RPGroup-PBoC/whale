For a combination of pedagogical and logistical reasons, all of the programming in the course will be done in Python using Google Colab notebooks.

Content will be posted here as the course progresses!

## schedule
There are two notebooks for you to explore independently:
- [Tutorial 0: Introduction to Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fq_HaiuYb1L18uGcoA3eGs6taiUafR-6?usp=sharing) covers our approach to programming in our courses.
You may disregard the final section ("Using Colab for Bi 1"), which is specific to a different, undergraduate course.
(You will not need to submit homework for this bootcamp!)
- [Tutorial 0: Introduction to Python](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WGEmPLcuYrGZ7IfvKAqWjRi7yTrTx6k9?usp=sharing) is a gentle, abridged introduction to the Python programming language.
It's far from comprehensive, but if you're new to the subject, it's a great place to start.
