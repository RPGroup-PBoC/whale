## External resources

* [The Human Impacts Database](https://anthroponumbers.org/). Useful quantities describing the interactions of humans with Earth's land, oceans, atmosphere, flora and fauna.

* [The Bionumbers Database](https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu/search.aspx). An incredibly handy collection of numbers from the molecular and cell biology literature.

* [Street-Fighting Mathematics: The Art of Educated Guessing and Opportunistic Problem Solving](https://sept.mit.edu/sites/default/files/Streetfighting%20Mathematics.pdf). This excellent free book by Sanjoy Mahajan (a Caltech alum!) teaches order-of-magnitude estimation in the same style that we will employ throughout the course. Essential reading for those curious to explore more advanced techniques than those we will cover.
